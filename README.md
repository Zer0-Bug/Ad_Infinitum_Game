# Ad Infinitum - Commodore 64 Game Recreation in C++ for Windows

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a modern recreation of the Commodore 64 game **Ad Infinitum**, originally an early version of **W.A.R.** (released by Martech in 1986). The project is implemented in **C++ for Windows** using the **icbytes** library, which provides tools for low-level programming and graphics handling. The goal was to replicate the core gameplay mechanics of the original Commodore 64 version while adapting it to a modern Windows environment.

## 📜 About Ad Infinitum (Commodore 64)
**Ad Infinitum** is an unreleased prototype of the space shooter **W.A.R.**, developed for the Commodore 64. 

### ⚠️Key Features of the Original Game:
- **Genre:** Horizontal scrolling shooter.
- **Gameplay:** Players control a spaceship that can move in both directions (left and right), similar to *Uridium*. The objective is to navigate through waves of enemies and obstacles.
- **Graphics:** Utilizes the Commodore 64’s **VIC-II** chip for sprite-based graphics and smooth scrolling.
- **Differences from W.A.R.:** 
  - Unlike the final **W.A.R.** release, which restricted movement to one direction, **Ad Infinitum** allowed **bidirectional scrolling**.
  - The prototype also featured a **title screen font** resembling *Uridium*, hinting at its inspiration.
- **Technical Details:** 
  - Written in **6502 assembly language**.
  - Leveraged the Commodore 64’s **1 MHz CPU** and **64 KB of RAM**.

The game was altered before release, likely to avoid legal issues due to its similarities with *Uridium*. This project aims to preserve the original prototype’s spirit.

## 🎯 Project Description
This implementation recreates **Ad Infinitum** using **C++** on Windows, with the **ICBYTES** library facilitating graphics, input, and sound management. The code maintains the essence of the original gameplay while adapting it to a modern OS.

### Features
- **Bidirectional spaceship movement** (left and right).
- **Sprite-based enemies and obstacles**.
- **Simple collision detection**.
- **Basic sound effects** (inspired by the SID chip’s capabilities).
- **Runs natively on Windows** with a retro aesthetic.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries
- **C++**: Core programming language for logic and structure.
- **ICBYTES Library**: A lightweight library for Windows (available at [otoidrak.com](https://otoidrak.com/)). It provides:
  - Graphics rendering (pixel manipulation and sprite drawing).
  - Keyboard input handling.
  - Basic audio output.
- **Development Environment**: Written and tested using **Visual Studio 2022** on **Windows 10**.
